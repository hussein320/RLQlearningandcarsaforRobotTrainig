# RLQlearningandcarsaforRobotTrainig
In this project i build a greedy world Environment and i trained a robot to find the exit using ON &amp; OFF-POLICY algorithm Sarsa and Qlearning, and in the scope of this project is to do a full comparison between these two off-model methods, including sensitivity to rewards and parameters.
